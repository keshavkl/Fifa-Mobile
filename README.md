Player data from web-crawling with cleaning

The data is taken from http://futmobile.net/ , a database for all the  data on players on Fifa Mobile.

The purpose of this is to analyse players based on multiple stats and select the best teams based on the stats.

The code will retrieve all the data from futmobile server, cleans the data, creates all the required variables including all the stats and finally creates two files, one for all the goalkeepers and another for all the outfield players.
